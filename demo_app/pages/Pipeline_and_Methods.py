        This study compares a range of algorithms from classical to modern:
        - **ARIMA:** Traditional statistical model, used as a baseline.
        - **Random Forest / XGBoost / SVM:** Powerful supervised machine learning models, perform well on tabular data after feature extraction.
        - **LSTM / Transformer:** Deep learning models designed for time series data, capable of learning long-term dependencies.
        
        **Goal:** Identify which model provides the best trend forecasting accuracy on this dataset.

        - **Markowitz (Mean-Variance):** Foundation of modern portfolio theory. Relies only on historical data (mean returns and covariance matrix) for optimization. Commonly used as a baseline.
        - **Black-Litterman:** An improvement over Markowitz, allows combining **investor views** (from model signals like XGBoost) with **market expectations**. This helps create more stable and realistic portfolios.
        - **Reinforcement Learning (RL - PPO/A2C):** A completely different approach. Instead of a one-time calculation, RL trains an **agent** through thousands of trial-and-error episodes in a simulated environment. The agent learns flexibly to make asset allocation decisions to maximize long-term reward.
